1. there is no read functionality in stories, just play
a. there is no quick add word/phrase from reading to dictionary
2. there is a routing error or something, when i click on the exit arrow from the story it properly goes back to the reading practice, but when i click the arrow in reading practice, it then goes back to the story.
