1. in the content section, there is no proper padding below, so half of the last 2 cards are not visible
2. there is no proper get back arrow in the content section, but only header and navigation below
3. 'start review' and 'watch & learn' being in one box are blended in, user don't destinguish content suggestion as another feature. so we better mavo it to a separate container within home tab
4. daily progress is not properly implemented, same for activity history got to check them both:
a. we don't have a step or an option to configure goal there
b. it doesn't work properly cause i've got only 1 word in dictionary but it shows 5/20. plus it's unclear what it shows, all the words, words mastered, no logic there.
5. in the games, there is no proper padding, scrolling, not auto adjustable containers to fill the screen. + in dungeon game, users shouldn't be able to select level, shey should complete each level of a dungeon, get some exp, advance in level, recieve some name [amatuer, word wizard, etc].
6. actually the header doesn't have no purpose, only takes up space, so we better remove it, only have it in settings, somwhere down below as a name. and instead of it, have some nice padding.
